# Empirical monotonicity of ROE relative to good-bad progression

This implementation follows step by step the content of Chap. 4, section 4.5.6 :  Empirical monotonicity, pp. 157-160<br>

## Purpose

## Method

> <p><strong>Comparison between BADGOOD distribution and a binned ROE</strong> - -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/DLMM-IRating-in-R/tree/main/steps/step7/binning)</p>
> <p><strong>Comparison between BADGOOD distribution and the sign of ROE numerator and denominator</strong> - -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/DLMM-IRating-in-R/tree/main/steps/step7/signs)</p>
> <p><strong>Developing a var/BADGOOD monotonicity detection scheme</strong> - -> (https://github.com/MoiraCorp/DLMM-IRating-in-R/tree/main/steps/step7/monotonicity)</p>
