## Exploring Gaussian Copula (Anamorphosis) encoding

The gaussian anamorphosis, known also as **Gaussian Copula encoding** is a mathematical function which transforms a variable X with any density distribution into a new variable Y with a Gaussian density distribution. As the Linear Discriminant Analysis method is based on the comparison between GOOD and BAD groups which variables are normaly distributed (idem, Guassian), Gaussian Copula encoding is a way to adapt the data so that it optimaly fits the LDA instrument. 

This aspect of data pre-processing is addressed by the authors in section 4.5.9 Transformationof indicators (pages: 164-177). Although it is there essentially based on the use of formula based transformations and not in terms of a transformative transition between probability distributions.
