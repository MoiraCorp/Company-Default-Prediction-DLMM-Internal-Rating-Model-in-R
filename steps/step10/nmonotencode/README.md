## Encoding of empirical non-monotonicity: the case of the ROE ratio

In this section, the authors suggest an “experimental” computation of the probabilty of default contionned to intervals of values of a particular using the isopopulation bin.var() binning function described in Step 7 - Empirical monotonicity of ROE relative to good-bad progression - Comparison between BADGOOD distribution and a binned ROE. The isopopulation intervals are named “indicator” intervals by the authors.<br>

NOTE: Binning is a well known technique.
J-P Benzécri has offered a general theoretical background for these techniques, naming them as “probablity transition transform". They offer ways of Transforming (transitionning) one probability distribution into another. A somewhat simplified version of this concept is found in Markov transition probablity matrices. For example, in image processing, binning is used for contrast enhancement. In other occasions the binning is used in order to transform any distribution into a Normal distribution.<p>

The authors make a point at the interpolation (idem, smoothing) of the probability of each Ratio Variable. They are proposing to use a Logit Transformation for this purpose <em>BUT no pratical example is provided at this stage</em>.<br>
They also points out that there exist a fair amount of subjectivity in the determination of the number of intervals in the binning encoding. Even more so if the intervals are “manually tweaked” in order to enforce the monotonocity.
