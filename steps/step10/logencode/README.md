## Transformation of indicators using a logistic formula: the case of the ROE ratio

Many of the accounting variables as well their Ratios display a form of LogNormal distribution. This is often encountered form in the statistical distribution of “quantities” either in nature or in the social sciences.<br>
The logistic formula offers a way to transform the variables so that their distribution is closer to a Normal distribution. As it applies a Log transform, it is also another way to reduce the influence of “extreme” values (idem, “extreme” outliers)
