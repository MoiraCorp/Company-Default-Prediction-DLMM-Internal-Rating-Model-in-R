## Transformation of indicators using a logistic formula: the case of the ROE ratio

Many of the accounting variables as well their Ratios display a form of LogNormal distribution. This is often encountered form in the statistical distribution of “quantities” either in nature or in the social sciences.<br>
The logistic formula offers a way to transform the variables so that their distribution is closer to a Normal distribution. As it applies a Log transform, it is also another way to reduce the influence of “extreme” values (idem, “extreme” outliers)In SPPS, the CDF.LOGISTIC function can be used for the perform a LogNormal to Normal distribution transformation (-> https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/beta?topic=functions-cumulative-distribution)</p>
In SPPS, the CDF.LOGISTIC function can be used for the perform a LogNormal to Normal distribution transformation (-> https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/beta?topic=functions-cumulative-distribution)<br>
It is call as: CDF.LOGISTIC(quant, mean, scale) and returns the cumulative probability that a value from the logistic distribution, with the specified mean and scale parameters, will be less than quant.
