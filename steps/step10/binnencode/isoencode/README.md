## Isopopulation «binning» of Log10-SALES in order to explore concordances of SALES level with default rate

Here we use an “isopupulation” binning method similar to the one already used in order to study the monotonicity of the Ratio Variables,
a technique already used in section Step7-Binning (--> https://github.com/MoiraCorp/DLMM-IRating-in-R/tree/main/steps/step7/binning). However, due to the strong LogNormal nature of the SALES probability distribution we will prefer to work with the Log10 of SALES rather than with the original values.
