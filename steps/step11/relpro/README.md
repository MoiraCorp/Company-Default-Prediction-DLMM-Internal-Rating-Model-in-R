## Theoretical relation as a function of probability of default f(p(D))

In section 4.5.1 Indicators economic meanings, working hypotheses and structural monotonicity (page 117-129), the authors describe
the Ratio Variables selected in order to build an Internal Rating of companies.

For each of these variables an argument is developed on their theoretical potential relation with the probability of default of the companies.
In particular, it is specified for each indicator (idem, Ratio Variable) if it varies positively or negatively
as a function of the probability of default.

This sign of variation (or correlation) is entered in the first column of the synoptic table: Ratios_Synoptic_De Laurentis.xls
