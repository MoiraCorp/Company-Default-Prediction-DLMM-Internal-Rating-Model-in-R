## Correlation between Ratio Variables

We are gathering here the results of 7b) Correlation study for all ratio variables (page 162)
while checking visually on the bi-variable cloud points displayed in Outlier-Treatment_Page165_AllvariableswithCT_CoorDiag.pdf

The list of correlated Ratio Variables are added as a column to the synoptic table: Ratios_Synoptic_De Laurentis.xls

The list of correlated Ratio Variables are added as the column “Correlation Group” from the synoptic table:  <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/MoiraCorp/DLMM-IRating-in-R/blob/main/steps/step11/relpro/assets/Ratios_Synoptic_De%20Laurentis.xls">Ratios_Synoptic_De Laurentis.xls</a>
