## Histograms and Normality hypothesis for Ratio Variables

In order to use a Machine Learning methods (ML) such as Linear Discriminant Analysis it is important to test if the variables are normally distributed and take appropriate encoding action when they are not. It is particularly the case when the distribution of the variables is log-normal.

Here we follow a two steps approachÂ :
